# devops-project6

**This task is exactly same as task3 but here I have done with  different approach to solve problem.The approach I used here is "Jenkins groovy script"
and Concept of seed job .**

#PREREQUISITE:#

**Jenkins, Minikube , Kubectl set up and Rhel 8 as os:**

**Plugins required to be installed:**

(a) Job DSL (b) GitHub plugin (c) Email Extension Plugin (d)Build Pipeline Plugin 

**All we need to do is use our DSL script(which I have given here as seed-job.groovy) in Seed-job.**

**After running the seed Job our all Four Jobs and Build Pipeline View will be created automatically.**
